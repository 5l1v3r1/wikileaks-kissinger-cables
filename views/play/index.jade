            p The map shows the borders between countries circa 1975. Some countries changed shapes between 1973 and 1976. In these cases, we chose to represent the borders that help understand the situation best. Other borders that we show do not reflect the opinions of the Great Powers. Namibia was nominally independent in the 1970's, Sinai nominally belonged to Egypt and many countries recognized Western Sahara. But they were ruled by South Africa, Israel and jointly by Morocco and Mauritania after a Spanish withdrawal in 1975.
            p On this map, we chose to represent reality over political correctness. We're journalists, not diplomats.
            p The only place we failed to accurately represent is divided Berlin. Our parser had too hard a time differenciating between East and West. If you want to help us get in right, get in touch on GitHub.
